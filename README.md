# Pyramid-Descent-Puzzle
A Pyramid Descent Puzzle consists of a pyramid of positive integers. To solve the puzzle, you must find a path that traverses the pyramid from top to bottom visiting numbers whose product is a given target value. Each step in the path must go down one row, and go either one step to the left or one step to the right.


Returns * if target product is impossible to reach. \
Otherwise, it returns the path from the top of the pyramid. \
L = Left step \
R = Right Step
